# EasyEats
App development project from 2019:
Basic with the main aim to make shopping lists easier and reduce food waste:
The app allowed users to enter set types of meals they eat with each ingredient,
Then when they went to shop, they can simply check what ingredients they need for X servings of meal 1 and Y servings of meal 2
The app will collate all the ingredients needed such that you dont accidentally over buy and leave food wasted.
